# Brad Holmes — Cybersecurity Engineer | Windows Internals | Blue‑Team Tooling

I’m a systems‑minded cybersecurity engineer specializing in Windows internals, defensive tooling, and modular blue‑team automation. My background in HVAC, fire suppression, and technical systems gave me a strong foundation in troubleshooting, diagnostics, and understanding how complex systems behave under load.  

Today, I design and maintain **ThermoSuite**, a collection of PowerShell‑based defensive utilities focused on visibility, hardening, and system health — all built with a user‑controlled, non‑intrusive approach.

## ThermoSuite Ecosystem

### **ThermoPilot‑Universal**
A lightweight thermal governor and system monitor built for reliability and clarity.  
- PowerShell‑based for transparency  
- No installation, no registry writes  
- Universal hardware support  
- Safety‑first design philosophy  

### **ThermoNet**
Network visibility and Wi‑Fi environment assessment.  
- Identifies interference and congestion  
- Provides actionable, non‑intrusive insights  
- Built for blue‑team situational awareness  

### **ThermoCleaner**
System cleanup and hardening with user‑approved controls.  
- No silent changes  
- Clear explanations for every action  
- Mullvad‑style transparency  

### **ThermoGuard**
Endpoint hardening with reversible, documented configurations.  
- Focused on operational safety  
- Built for training, consulting, and SOC workflows

## Engineering Philosophy

### **Transparency Over Obfuscation**  
Users should always understand what a tool does. PowerShell keeps everything visible, inspectable, and trustworthy.

### **User‑Controlled, Not System‑Intrusive**  
No silent changes, no hidden behavior, no binaries that trigger AV heuristics. Everything is reversible and documented.

### **Modular, Teachable, and Operationally Safe**  
Tools should be easy to audit, easy to explain, and safe to run in real environments — ideal for SOC, consulting, and training use.
